# xv6

xv6 is the operating system used in the MIT's [Operating System Engineering course](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2023/index.html).

This repository contains my solution to the lab exercises from the course.

## BUILDING AND RUNNING XV6

You will need a RISC-V "newlib" tool chain from
https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain, and qemu compiled for
riscv64-softmmu.  Once they are installed, and in your shell
search path, you can run "make qemu".
